# DRA818V_module
This is a ham radio transceiver based on the DRA818V module. Work is under progress. 

The PCB files are created in altium designer. 
Schematic symbol and Footprint are linked at this point. Schematic design is under way.

Code for actually using the module would be posted in another repo at a later stage.
